# MERN Chat app
A full-stack React based web application for real-time chatting purpose <br>
Made using React and Styled-components for the front-end, and an express server bundled with MongoDB datastore for backend <br>
Socket.io is used to create real-time low-latency connection between server and clients <br>

# Instructions

Open the `public` folder and `server` folder seperately. <br>
